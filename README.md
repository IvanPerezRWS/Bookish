# Bookish
_A wealth of knowledge_

### The Pitch
When you buy a book, statistically speaking, you are only going to read the book once. So why not give an opportunity for other people to read the books you enjoyed. Bookish is a literature focused social media platform that allows users to message eachother to trade books. 

### Basic functions
Users should expect to do the following:
* Login authentication
* Be able to create modify or delete posts
  * Posts should be able to include a brief description as well as a small filesize picture (if possible)

### Potential features
* Users should potentially be able to sell used books
